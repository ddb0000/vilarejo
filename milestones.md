# Milestones

## m0 · Prototype Loop (Nov 2025)
Status: ✅
- Deterministic 5 Hz engine with pause/step, seeding, snapshots, structured event bus.
- Routine fallback (wake/work/socialize/rest) with urgent/memory deviations.
- Inspector + RRI breakdown, target highlight, dev injector, smoke test.
- Acceptance quickies (see README) all pass.

## m1 · Village Behaviors (Next)
Goals:
- Distinct archetype routines + shared day scheduler (morning chores, lunch, evening wind-down).
- Replayable seeds (persist + reload), small AI bridge stub (flagged, BYOK fetch gateway).
- Observation scripts expanded (markets, weather) and configurable runbooks for story beats.

## m2 · Narrative Arcs (Later)
Goals:
- Lightweight quest chains, shared memory prompts, automated story screenshots/GIFs.
- CLI tooling for seeds + snapshots, regression harness for acceptance quickies.

## m3 · Playable Slice (Stretch)
Goals:
- Host on Cloudflare Pages with guided onboarding, doc GIFs, and public demo toggle.
- Optional chat-driven inspector + prompt editing, stabilized API for future AI hookups.
